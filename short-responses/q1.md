Yes, controllers parse "requests" and send a response. But middleware is more than "just a statement that happens in the backend". 

Similar to controllers, middleware parses requests. But instead of sending a response, middleware will pass the request along to the next middleware / controller in the chain.

Typo: "response", not "responce"
